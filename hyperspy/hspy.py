    Any extra argument is passes to the Model constructor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal: A signal class

    If the signal is an EELS signal the following extra parameters
    are available:

    auto_background : boolean
        If True, and if spectrum is an EELS instance adds automatically
        a powerlaw to the model and estimate the parameters by the
        two-area method.
    auto_add_edges : boolean
        If True, and if spectrum is an EELS instance, it will
        automatically add the ionization edges as defined in the
        Spectrum instance. Adding a new element to the spectrum using
        the components.EELSSpectrum.add_elements method automatically
        add the corresponding ionisation edges to the model.
    ll : {None, EELSSpectrum}
        If an EELSSPectrum is provided, it will be assumed that it is
        a low-loss EELS spectrum, and it will be used to simulate the
        effect of multiple scattering by convolving it with the EELS
        spectrum.
    GOS : {'hydrogenic', 'Hartree-Slater', None}
        The GOS to use when auto adding core-loss EELS edges.
        If None it will use the Hartree-Slater GOS if
        they are available, otherwise it will use the hydrogenic GOS.

    Returns
    -------

    A Model class
